# TrainingCollege

The TrainingCollege is a courses institutions platform for both instituions and students. Instituions can settle in the platform and
upload the courses. Student uses can find the courses they are interested in and purchase the courses.

The sturctue is based on Spring + Hibernate + Struts framework. We used MySQL to imitate the database to store instituions, course
information and students' information. At front end, web pages were written by JavaScript.
